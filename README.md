# Low-Level-String-to-Integer-Procedure

# This program takes user input of 10 integers as strings capable of fitting in a 32-bit register. The strings are converted to integers
# and are stored as SDWORDS in an array. The program will calculate the sum and average of the array. Finally, the program will 
# convert the SDWORDS back to strings and display them, in addition to the sum and average of the array.
